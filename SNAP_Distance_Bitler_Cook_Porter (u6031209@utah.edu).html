# Motivation

- US somewhat unique within advanced economies in design of safety net. System very federalized with various levels of government running programs

- People apply to many programs and rules not harmonized `\(\Rightarrow\)` low take-up is more of issue in US than other places (.smallest[.red[Currie, 2006]]) 

--

- Social program take-up: hot topic in public econ, yet understudied
  - Emphasis on understanding role of barriers to accessing safety net
  
-  Barriers impact both .hi-red[take-up] (how many people enroll) and .hi-red[targeting] (what types of people enroll) &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;

.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; Though take up and targeting alone are not enough to assess normative implications (.smallest[.red[Finkelstein &amp; Notowidigdo, 2019]])]



---

# Motivation

## Competing Models to Explain Low Take-Up

### .hi-red[Neoclassical model]
- People make decisions balancing costs and benefits in a utility maximizing framework
- Incomplete take-up is a function of barriers: 
  - **Incomplete information**: Program existence, eligibility rules
  - **Stigma**: Either concerns about whether you should participate or about how others will judge you
  - **Transaction costs**: Either is more costly to enroll if you have to travel more, or the documentation or time costs are higher

--

Under this framework, .hi-green[barriers could be efficient if improve targeting] (i.e., deter those without need or target those in need) .smallest[(.red[Ackerlof, 1978; Nichols &amp; Zeckhauser, 1982; Besley &amp; Coate, 1992; Kleven &amp; Kopczuk, 2011])]  

  
---
# Motivation

## Competing Models to Explain Low Take-Up

### .hi-red[Behavioral science  model] 
- Limited bandwidth or stress impairs people. Suggests incomplete take-up might be harmful or inefficient (.smallest[.red[Bertrand, Mullainathan, &amp; Shafir, 2004]])

### .hi-red[Administrative Burden] 
- Government actors may intentionally create "administrative burden" to limit use, possibly due to limited capacity (.smallest[.red[Herd and Moynihan, 2019]])


Under these models, .hi-red[barriers could be inefficient if worsen targeting], e.g., if the poor face limited bandwidth or scarcity, more needy individuals could be deterred by hassle costs

# Literature

---
# Finkelstein and Notowidigdo (2019)

- Model for social welfare incorporates social costs and perceptions of costs of application (.red[looking at targeting is not enough])

- Fit parameters with RCT on Medicaid participants not on SNAP

- Did information and application help affect take-up and targeting?



--

- Assistance `\(&gt;\)` information `\(&gt;\)` status quo; Compliers are better off

- Worse targeting for all interventions
--

- Quantify costs of assessing eligibility?
  - Understanding expense of eligibility assessment would help determine size of wedge between social and private welfare
  - Efforts to cut cost of eligibility would help shrink wedge
  


---
# Literature

Remaining literature can be conceptualized as studying how different types of barriers impact .red[take-up] and .red[targeting]
---
# Barriers Impact **Take-Up**
## Information Barriers

- SNAP-eligible people often don't realize eligibility (.smallest[.red[Bartlett et al., 2004]]); providing information increases take-up (.smallest[.red[Daponte, Sanders, &amp; Taylor, 1999; Finkelstein and Notowidigdo, 2019]])
- Informational interventions matter in some other contexts as well: **EITC** (.smallest[.red[Bhargava and Manoli, 2015]]) and **SSDI** (.smallest[.red[Armour, 2018]]), but not others: **FAFSA** (.smallest[.red[Bettinger et al., 2012]])

--

## Transaction Costs

- Reducing transaction costs in **SNAP** increases take-up via: application help (.smallest[.red[Schanzenbach, 2001; Finkelstein and Notowidigdo, 2019]]), certification periods (.smallest[.red[Kabbani and Wilde, 2003]]), certification requirements (.smallest[.red[Hanratty, 2006]])
- Access to program offices matters:  **SSA** offices (.smallest[.red[Deshpande and Li, 2019]]) and **WIC** program offices/vendors (.smallest[.red[Rossin-Slater, 2013; Ambrozek, 2021]])

&lt;!-- - Assistance in completing **FAFSA** (.smallest[.red[Bettinger et al., 2012]]) --&gt;
&lt;!-- - Online **UI** applications (.smallest[.red[Stange and Ebenstein, 2010]]) --&gt;


---

Evidence during COVID about **WIC** participation being affected by pick up and enrollment rules (in person/not) **MB, do you have specific cites in mind?**

---
# Barriers Impact **Targeting**

Much less work on how barriers impact **targeting** 

--

## Information Barriers
- Complexity worsens targeting of low-income cases for EITC (.smallest[.red[Bhargava and Manoli, 2015]])
- Information mailers induce less-needy households to enroll in SNAP (.smallest[.red[Finkelstein and Notowidigdo, 2019]])

--

## Transaction Costs
- Closing SSA offices had mixed impacts on who is deterred (.smallest.red[Deshpande and Li, 2019])
- SNAP application assistance reduces targeting across all dimensions (.smallest[.red[Finkelstein and Notowidigdo, 2019]]) 





---

# Our Contribution

- First assessment of how access to in-person assistance via opening/closing SNAP offices and SNAP-authorized stores (.red[coming soon]) impacts participation and targeting

- Provide evidence that reducing transaction costs via access to SNAP offices .hi-red[increases participation] and .hi-red[improves targeting]

- Our setting includes multiple relevant actors: SNAP-authorized stores and program offices
  - Literature has looked at one of these in isolation with limited focus on private actors (.smallest[.red[Handbury &amp; Moshary, 2021; Beatty, Bitler, and van Der Werf, 2021; Meckel, 2020]]).




---
# Our Contribution

- We link Census data on residential location with comprehensive administrative data on SNAP take-up and information on SNAP offices and SNAP-authorized retailers

- Not possible to study this question with existing surveys due to limited sample sizes and data quality issues

- We study population within states and don’t have to focus samples with limited generalizability (previous RCT literature)

- Rich administrative data on other programs and mobility

- Samples which permit us to explore staggered adoption designs

- This is a first stage for work to come on outcomes

# Institutional Background
---
# SNAP

- Backbone of US safety net

- Only US safety net program available to nearly all low-income households

- Means tested (income and asset tests) and includes work requirements for some households (i.e., ABAWDs)

- Certification periods typically 6-12 months (seniors 24+ months; ABAWD 3 months)
  - In-person or phone interview required along with income verification

---
# SNAP
## Application Process

.pull-left[
- Some heterogeneity across states

- Many states have online application portals and hotlines
  - Most people still submit applications in person

- Most states have switched from face-to-face to phone interview

- Provide household information and records of income/assets

# SNAP 
## Role of SNAP Offices

- Typically provide in-person assistance navigating application process

- .red[Application prevalence]: in-person `\(&gt;\)` online `\(&gt;\)` fax `\(&gt;\)` email `\(&gt;\)` phone

- SNAP offices are opened in places of need

- Typically provide resources to connect SNAP applicants to other assistance programs (e.g., HUD, TANF, Medicaid, LEAP, WIC)

- Can even directly apply to some other programs (state dependent)

## Overlap
- Within a mile, .hi-red[12%] of cases overlap in .hi-red[rural] counties

- Within a mile, .hi-blue[28%] of cases overlap in .hi-blue[urban] counties

## Distances
- Most analyses focus on SNAP cases within **1 mile of the SNAP Office**

  - Roughly **25th percentile** of distance distribution
  
- Also explore distances of `\(\color{#b92e34 }{(1,10]}\)` miles for .hi-red[rural] and `\(\color{#07506F }{(1,4]}\)` for .hi-blue[urban]

# Share affected by Openings/Closings



&lt;img src="SNAP_Distance_Bitler_Cook_Porter_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="100%" /&gt;
- **Meaningful share of recipients live near SNAP offices**
- Of the .hi-red[27,540,000 rural cases] we observe:
  - 695,000 live &lt; 1 mile of opening office (781,000 for closing office)
- Of the .hi-blue[24,590,000 urban cases] we observe:
  - 452,000 live &lt; 1 mile of opening office (843,000 for closing office)
---

# Case Characteristics by Office Type


.center[![:scale 100%](figs/char1.png)]

- .hi-red[Rural]: Monthly income ~ $200 lower near **opening/closing** offices
- .hi-blue[Urban]: Monthly income ~ $100 lower near **closing** offices
- **All**: Monthly income higher for recipients far away from offices

---

# Case Characteristics by Office Type


.center[![:scale 100%](figs/char2.png)]

- .hi-blue[Urban Counties]: Lower share of Black recipients near opening offices

- **Both**: Recipients far away from offices are less likely to be Black/Hispanic and more likely to be White

---

# Case Characteristics by Office Type


.center[![:scale 100%](figs/char3.png)]

- Characteristics relatively balanced across office type

# Empirical Design


---

# Empirical Design

## Preferred Specification - Two-way Fixed Effects

`$$y_{it} = \sum_{\tau}\beta_\tau 1(t-E_i = \tau) + \gamma_i + \theta_t + \epsilon_{it}$$`
- `\(i\ -\)` SNAP office

- `\(t\ -\)` calendar year

- `\(E_i\ -\)` year of opening/closing

--

- Panel design hinges on exogenous timing of openings/closings

  - Unobserved determinants of SNAP participation not differentially trending  across office types


---

# Empirical Design

`$$y_{it} = \sum_{\tau}\beta_\tau 1(t-E_i = \tau)+  \gamma_i + \theta_t + \epsilon_{it}$$`

- Run on a panel balanced over main event times `\(\tau \in [-3,3]\)`

- Coefficients estimated for all event times, but only report `\(\tau \in [-3,3]\)`

- Cluster standard errors by SNAP office

--

- Sample includes all SNAP offices and event time is only calculated for treated offices (i.e., opening or closing)

- Test robustness to heterogeneous treatment effects (.smallest[.red[de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfœuille, 2020]])
  
  
  
---
# Empirical Design
## Exogeneity of our Variation

- Characteristics of SNAP recipients near SNAP offices relatively similar across office types (i.e., opening/closing/any)
  - **Caveat:** Urban offices tend to open in whiter neighborhoods and close in lower-income neighborhoods
--

- SNAP recipients far away from offices had much higher income and more likely to be White
  - Analysis only focuses on recipients in close vicinity of offices
  - Unlikely to target neighborhood characteristics in such close vicinity
  - Also leverage *timing* of changes in surrounding years
--

- Explore event studies on SNAP participation, mobility, SNAP store landscape, other program participation
- Plan to use data on Dun &amp; Bradstreet firms and the locations of SNAP offices and stores to see that openings and closings are not affected by aggregate retail trends

# Conclusion

- Access to SNAP offices meaningfully .hi-red[increases program participation]

- Particularly important for those families without income (i.e., .hi-red[improved targeting])

- Interesting because many states are fully online with active help phone lines

- Face-to-face assistance may provide additional aid overcoming administrative burden?

- Policy implications to increase in-person assistance for applications
  - Similar to mobile WIC clinics?

---
# Next Steps

- Qualitatively examine mechanisms for why office may matter

- Similar analysis for distance to SNAP-authorized retailers and businesses more generally (D&amp;B)

- Robustness to population changes

- Mobility outcomes

- Use as IV to explore impact of SNAP on other outcomes
